<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<br>

<p class="w3-justify">Every now and then, we read some bulge brackets hit the headline, “XXX will reach 99999€ in 20YY”. Some forecasts hit the bull’s eye but most projections are as accurate as astrology. Price prediction can be easily influenced by the cognitive bias. In the financial market, there is merit to the idea that <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consensusestimate.asp>consensus estimate</a> is the best oracle. By harnessing the power of ensemble learning, we are about to leverage <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/machine-learning/blob/master/Wisdom%20of%20Crowds%20project/dawid%20skene.ipynb>Dawid-Skene model</a> and <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/machine-learning/blob/master/Wisdom%20of%20Crowds%20project/platt%20burges.ipynb>Platt-Burges model</a> to eliminate the idiosyncratic noise associate with each individual judgement. The end game is to reveal the underlying intrinsic value generated by the collective knowledge of research analysts from different investment banks. Is wisdom of crowds a crystal ball for trading? </p>

<p class="w3-justify">To evaluate the accuracy of the consensus estimate, 11 commodity prices forecasted by 8 different investment banks are collected as a sample. For any outsider, investment banks do not revise their forecast frequently, especially their long-term forecast. Because investment banks generate their revenue via customers’ block trading instead of report subscriptions. There is no incentive for any research analyst to frequently change the tune of the underlying asset. Apart from no extra bonus, it also makes them seem indecisive and poor at making prediction (which is true, you will see…). Has anyone watched the TV show “Industry”? One big night with the client is worth a thousand reports! Report writers are at the bottom of the food chain.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">With that being said, we are only examining current year and one-year ahead outlooks. Unfortunately, these banks do not publish reports at the same date. We cannot pick a random date and expect numbers from all the banks. Oddly enough, most of the investment banks publish new research piece in August. With two-thirds of a year is passed, analysts are busy revising everything. This is where our dataset comes from. We take current year and one-year ahead outlook written in August 2019 to form a bank vs commodity matrix where each element is the normalized forecast price (percentage return). To ensure we end up with a complete matrix (to do matrix completion is another level of the problem), bank candidates are shortlisted to BMO, BOAML, Citi, Commonwealth, Deutsche, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and TD securities. Commodities are filtered into Brent, copper, Henry Hub, nickel, silver, WTI, thermal coal and zinc.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">To effectively measure the wisdom of crowds, we need a control group – spot price. Initially, we would’ve thought spot price is a terrible idea. The market is turbulent and the spot price prediction is always flat. We can always expect some amount of forecast error coming out of it. In our best-case scenario, consensus estimate may be able to predict the exact price in the future. Well, mark-to-market is a standard practice in risk management. All open positions are marked to the spot market instead of the futures market. Spot price should contain more information than futures price in an efficient market. Thus, spot price will be on par with consensus estimate in our little experiment.</p>

<br>

<h3 id="descriptive-statistics">Descriptive Statistics</h3>

<br>

<p class="w3-justify">We start the experiment with the basics, descriptive statistics. What is the mean absolute error of each forecast? Does one particular bank outperform the rest? The chart below reveals the insight we are seeking for. For the current year outlook, consensus forecast error regardless of the commodity is 4% on average. Spot forecast error regardless of the commodity yields almost 8%, twice as large as consensus. Yet, I cannot say this is the wisdom of crowds. Since you can compute year-to-date average price with 66% of the data, how likely the rest 33% of the data is going to drift the annual average away? Additionally, the error is unequally distributed within the banks. The worst performer, BMO, has triple as much error as the best performer, Commonwealth. </p>

<p class="w3-justify">Next, we create a scatter plot to put consensus under further scrutiny. The chart is shown below where X axis represents consensus and Y axis represents spot. Coincidentally, consensus and spot never demonstrate the same systemic bias. It is always one overestimates ↑ and the other underestimates ↓. Aside from platinum which both consensus and spot are doing well (a sign of low volatility), spot always have a larger magnitude of systemic bias than consensus in other commodities because the diagonal line is at 45 degree where spot and consensus have the same scale of the bias. This phenomenon indicates 2019 was quite a volatile time for commodities. </p>

<br>

<p class="w3-justify">That’s enough about the current year outlook. As mentioned before, knowing 66% of the data is quite an unfair advantage for consensus. One year ahead forecast is how spot price level the playing field. The chart below shows how the performance of consensus forecast rapidly deteriorates. Spot forecast error regardless of the commodity is at least 5% less than consensus forecast error despite the fact it is twice as large as current year outlook. None of the banks can outperform spot price. Where is the wisdom of crowds? Furthermore, TD Securities and BMO are consistently the worst performers with errors at 25% and 30% respectively. Commonwealth maintains its reputation as the best prophet, still at 15% forecast error. I cannot stop wondering why Canadian bank is so bad given both Australia and Canada are big commodity exporters. </p>

<br>

<p class="w3-justify">The scatter plot is even more intriguing. Excluding precious metal silver and gold, the rest of the commodities are mostly in the spectrum of consensus ↑ and spot ↑. Well, we all know 2020 is a special year especially one particular mismanagement fucked up the whole world. The safe haven commodity behavior doesn’t arouse our interest. It is the data point under the diagonal line that suggests consensus forecast has a bigger scale of systemic bias in one year ahead outlook. spot ↑ is an indication of bearish market in 2020. We can easily derive that consensus forecast of 2020 > spot price in 2019 > actual price in 2020. With that being said, we have discovered a consensus forecast overshoot. Where does consensus optimism come from? Simple, momentum. If you look up the historical price, August 2019 happened to be the recovery period where price gradually picked up. In another word, hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on research reports are merely for a momentum check? No wonder people prefer to spend those dollars on big nights with clients &#x1f633; The idea of momentum may work on short term such as current year outlook. In one year ahead outlook, the wisdom of crowds just vanishes into thin air (or if it ever exists).</p>

<br>

<h3 id="dawid-skene-model">Dawid-Skene Model</h3>

<br>

<p class="w3-justify">Now that we have seen the malaise of descriptive statistics. The consensus average is supposed to eliminate random errors that affect each banker’s answer in a different way, yet the average error is still ridiculously large. Perhaps the method of averaging is too naïve. A more advanced model is summoned to tackle the base rate bias, the tendency for bankers to base predictions on what they know. </p>

<p class="w3-justify">Dawid-Skene Model was developed to assess a patient’s true response in regarding to different answers to different clinicians. Nowadays it is a common practice in crowd sourcing problem, e.g. data labelling for supervised learning. This model applies an algorithm on discrete classifications to aggregate individual opinions into one collective decision so that we can save money and time from domain knowledge training for data labelling. It takes into account of the heterogeneity of annotators and the complexity of fortune telling. </p>

<p class="w3-justify">DS Model is one of the few models where text explanation is more comprehensive than math notations. The model per se is solved via Expectation Maximization algorithm. The steps are illustrated below.</p>

<ol>

<li> Initialize the prior labels with majority voting technique.</li>

<li> E-step: compute the confusion matrix for each annotator and obtain the probability of each annotator’s current answer given the prior labels as conditional probability.</li>

<li> M-step: obtain the fraction of the prior labels as unconditional probability and multiply it by conditional probability. Compute the posterior labels based on each label’s possibility.</li>

<li> Repeat E-step and M-step until convergence. Convergence is defined as the posterior labels do not change over the iterations.</li>

</ol>

<p class="w3-justify">In our particular case, the annotators refer to the banks. Each question refers to a commodity. The models only contain two labels (I have never seen flat price forecast from banks), price upside risk and price downside risk.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">For current year outlook, the model yields the same answer as Citigroup, Commonwealth Bank, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs. On the bright side, half of the banks made a 100% accurate guess whereas the other half begs to differ on only one commodity – Platinum. On the dark side, this could be an indication of monoculture. For wisdom of crowds to work, there is one crucial element, diversity. The crowds must be characterized by different opinions and each person's opinion should be independent and free from the influence of others. DS Model cannot eliminate systematic errors that affect the opinions of the entire crowd. It can merely offset random errors caused by each person’s base rate bias. </p>

<p class="w3-justify">For one year ahead outlook, the model yields the same answer as JP Morgan, less than 40% of the price direction is correctly projected. Even for the best performers, Citigroup and BOAML, they do not outperform tossing a coin by any chance. In another word, these banks fail spectacularly. According to the result breakdown by commodities, nobody managed to get Aluminum and Henry Hub natural gas right. The ones with high accuracy are electric vehicle related – nickel, copper and platinum.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">Au fait, DS Model is an exceptional model to calibrate the base rate bias. In its defense, the poor performance in our task is caused by the lack of diverse opinions. Financial industry does not have a diverse pool of participants. The candidates are generally screened by target university and private school at the recruitment stage. Especially when it comes to research analysts, they don’t have any collective knowledge and they forecast the market based on public polling data.  When analysts are aware of what the competitors are writing, they usually come up with something deviating no more than one sigma from the mean to justify their stories. This type of consensus thinking can, unsurprisingly, lead to poor group decision making. To add more fuel to the fire, research analysts do not get paid by conducting excellent research or telling fascinating stories. Their KPI is based upon clients’ rating. Their ability to entertain the clients is somehow more influential than their research capability (one big night with the client is worth a thousand reports). To put it plainly, there are too many analysts who cannot do Newton-Leibniz theorem right and you expect them to tell you what the price would be in one year’s time? Beautiful anecdotical stories doesn’t mean shit in terms of proofs. </p>
