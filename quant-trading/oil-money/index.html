Amid the bullish outlook for crude oil, the currency exchange of oil producing countries would also bounce back. Does this statement really hold? Prior to this article by Bloomberg (or many other similar research), market analysts test the correlation between petrocurrency and oil price, instead of the causality. The issue is that correlation does not equal to causality. Correlation could be a coincidence of a math game. We simply cannot draw the conclusion that oil price moves the currency (the cause can be a third common factor such as inflation). Some researchers even introduce bootstrapping which, unfortunately, destroys the autocorrelation of time series. Thus, it is necessary for us to apply empirical analysis and computer simulation on various petrocurrencies to examine the underlying phenomenon.</p><p class="w3-justify">The following figure is a global oil production choropleth. The map lists out a couple of petrocurrencies with potential arbitrage opportunities. What can be easily overlooked is that some of the oil exporting economies peg domestic currencies to US dollar. For the central banks, the peg eliminates the volatile currency risk for oil exporting. For the traders, the room for petrocurrency arbitrage is squeezed. So it is crucial to verify the exchange rate regime of any oil exporting country from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_exchange_rate_regime>wikipedia</a> before moving onto any further analysis.</p><br>
  <iframe src="https://je-suis-tm.github.io/quant-trading/oil-money/oil-production/" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
    <p class="w3-justify">The figure below is a global oil production <a href=https://www.ft.com/content/678f78f8-a714-11e4-8a71-00144feab7de>cost curve</a>. Don't ask me why the data is 2015. They said <a href=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data>data is the new oil</a>, this is true especially when it comes to oil data. As we can see, the marginal players in this chart are Brazil and UK. Their production cost has reached 90% percentile among these countries. This explains the decade-long inactivity in North Sea oil field. The only feature of Aberdeen has been Angus beef (proudly made in Scotland) since the time of Margaret Thatcher. And for Brazil, Iâ€™d say the production cost absolutely has something to do with the corruption probe in Petrobras. Probably it is why iron ore export makes more money than crude oil in Amazon jungles (Vale is de jure privatized yet Petrobras is state-owned). Hence, we will exclude the largest crude oil producer in LATAM from our oil money project.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/oil%20production%20cost%20curve.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">Okay, enough about bad jokes. You may ask why I talk so much about commodity market at the beginning. If you think quantitative trading is about solving some complex stochastic process on commodity futures, prepare to lose a big chunk of money. You simply cannot quantify geopolitical risk or supply disruption by force majeure. <a href=https://www.ft.com/content/0093dcd4-ad59-11e9-8030-530adfa879c2>Some basic knowledge of underlying commodity</a> is vital to your trading strategy. </p><br><h3 id="norwegian-krone-and-brent-crude">Norwegian Krone and Brent Crude</h3><br><p class="w3-justify">In the original article by Bloomberg, the first mention is Norwegian Krone. Norway is one of my favorite places in Europe. Unlike Qatar or Saudi Arabia or any other Gulf/OPEC countries, the government doesn't heavily rely on oil or gas for its gross income (even though Equinor formerly Statoil is still a major player in Oslo Stock Exchange). According to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Norway#Economic_structure_and_sustained_growth>wikipedia</a>, over 60% of GDP is contributed by services in contrast to approximately 30% by industry in 2016 (arguably those services could still be oil-based like Dubai). Norway has established the largest sovereign fund in the world to hedge against oil price decline, ever since the discovery of north sea oil fields. Norway has non-petroleum industries such as fishing, maritime, renewable energy, etc. I doubt if oil price is the major driver of the exchange rate of NOK. I look into <a href=http://www.worldstopexports.com/norways-top-10-exports>international trading statistics</a> of Norway. Apparently, most trading partners are inside European Union. Prior to this report, I include Sterling and Euro into the price evaluation model of NOK. To my surprise, Norway actually does a lot of business with US. Hence, the model regressor consists of EUR, GBP, USD and Brent Crude. </p><p class="w3-justify">After the selection, we have to choose a base currency to evaluate NOK. It should be a stable entity with free floating FX regime with not much economic tie to Norway. I pick the safe haven currency in East Asia, Japanese Yen. In a released report by <a href=https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/nor>OEC</a>, Japan only accounts for less than 2% of exports in 2017 which makes a perfect candidate. Then all regressors in the model would be priced in JPY. Some of you may question why we do not use <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade-weighted_effective_exchange_rate_index>trade-weighted exchange rate</a>. Indeed, trade-weighted exchange rate is a better choice as it eliminates all other trading partner currencies in the model. The model can solemnly focus on the exporting commodities. However, the pain point is how to construct such exchange rate index. When we talk about trade weights, do we refer to surplus or deficit or total amount of trade? A country can certainly trade with more than 100 partners. Is it reasonable to include every trading partner currency into the weight? Or at what percentile of trade in values do we cut off the list? Why does that percentile make more sense than the others? Constructing a new index is rather state of art than social science. Obviously, it is easier and more efficient to use a non-trading partner currency for evaluation of all the variables. Hence, our regressor variables become EURJPY, GBPJPY, USDJPY and Brent Crude in JPY. Our regressand variable is NOKJPY.</p><p class="w3-justify">Arguably, the model should involve natural gas (Dutch TTF?) as well. From the website of <a href=https://www.norskpetroleum.no/en/production-and-exports/exports-of-oil-and-gas>norskpetroleum</a>, Norway supplies 25% of EU natural gas demand (mainly France and UK). It is interesting that many natural gas contracts are not tied to gas benchmark such as Henry Hub or TTF. In most cases, the price is linked to Brent, sometimes even <a href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-05/shell-breaks-market-mold-with-deal-linking-gas-prices-to-coal>coal</a>.</p><p class="w3-justify">Of course, there are other elements that affect NOK. It is widely acknowledged that change of interest rate impacts the foreign exchange significantly. However, the downside of interest rate is its slow response to the financial market. Central bankers assess the overall condition and review their decisions carefully and patiently. The rate hike may only occur after pickup of inflation rate or employment rate. It could be several times one year and silent for the next couple of years. By the time inflation rate is boosted by soaring oil price, NOK has priced that factor in for a long while. </p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20vs%20ir.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">Another important element is economic activity, GDP Year-on-Year growth. Inadequate amount of the data is its biggest flaw. GDP is usually released by statistics bureau quarterly. Forex market is agile and it moves every weekday 24/7. We cannot trade only 4 days a year and stay put for the rest of 246 days. Some indicators are seen as early signs, such as active oil rigs or social financing. These indicators are released on a monthly basis, slightly better than GDP.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20vs%20gdp.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">Thus, Brent and other currency pairs are undisputedly better inputs to reflect whether NOK is undervalued or overvalued at the moment.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20vs%20brent.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">The data of the past five years is collected from Thomson Reuters (now called Refinitiv). We denote the time horizon before 2017-04-25 as training period. We use that period to fit a regression model. From 2017-04-25 to the end of our dataset is defined as testing period. We use our model from training horizon to predict "reasonable" range of the value of NOK in testing horizon. This is a standard practice called cross validation by data scientists. Economists call it out-of-sample data for forward testing and in-sample data for backtesting. The regression result comes out as below. We have a pretty high R squared. All T stats and F stats seem to be significant. I have to take back my words. Brent shows a major influence on NOK which implies Norway still heavily depends on petrochemical industry. As the summary suggests, there could be multicollinearity (condition number is large and R squared is large). Obviously, Brent crude and US dollar should be negatively correlated. Most commodity future contracts are priced in US dollar. When US dollar appreciates or depreciates, the underlying commodity price is likely to go the opposite direction. There could be a cointegration relationship between Sterling and Euro for pre-Brexit time as well.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20correlation.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20model%20summary.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">In this case, we will use <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_net_regularization>elastic net regression</a> to implement regularization. Elastic net is a statistics/machine learning technique that consists of both Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regression to act as a penalty. Ideally it is a perfect tool for multicollinearity issues. </p><p class="w3-justify">Before backtesting, we ought to set up thresholds for signal generation. One sigma two-sided range is the common practice in statistical arbitrage. When actual NOK price goes above the upper threshold (larger than one sigma), we take a short position. We hold the belief that NOK is overvalued and it should fall back to its normal range very soon. Vice versa. However, the model is based on historical data. No models can precisely predict the future from the past. Our estimation is most likely to be overfitted and fail very quickly in the near future. We need to set up some thresholds for stop orders. When the model breaks, we could clear our positions and exit the trades gracefully. In that case, let's use another golden rule in statistics, two sigmas with 95% confidence interval, to do the trick. If NOK deviates 2 sigmas away from our fitted value, we need to realize the model is broken and we shall exit the trades right away. The figures below show the initial trading strategy. They demonstrate the positions of our statistical arbitrage and the actual price movement against the fitted value within confidence intervals.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20oil%20money%20positions.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20fitted%20vs%20actual.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">To our surprise, there is a strong momentum after our model breaks. The momentum is independent of the selection of our training horizon. In another word, no matter which period we use as training horizon, the strong momentum always follows through right after the model breaks. The failure of this model doesn't really upset me. On the contrary, it is a blessing in disguise. What I see is an opportunity for trend following strategy! We will get back to that very soon.</p><p class="w3-justify">What also interests me is why the model fails after 2017/11/15. Well, there is no way that a universal model can exist and work forever. Most models have short memory due to the dynamic environment of macroeconomics and geo-politics. Based on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_market_hypothesis>adaptive market hypothesis</a> developed by Professor Andrew Lo from MIT, the players in the market are always evolving along with the fast-paced environment. Therefore, we should anticipate our model to lose its power sooner or later. Still, what is the cause of the break? For a quantamental analysis, we have only completed the quant part. I would not get into too much of rigorous and boring part of the fundamentals. Instead, I intend to bring up a short but insightful discussion here. What could possibly be the reason of this dramatic change? Could it be that Saudi and Iran endorsed an extension of oil production cap to boost up the oil price on that particular date? Or Donald Trump got elected as POTUS so he would encourage a weak US dollar and lift up restrictions on oil export as promised during his campaign? If we consider the price of NOK as a stochastic process, we can decompose NOK price into long term trend and short term random disturbance. Well, apparently short term is dominated by Brent Crude. It partially justifies our model. What really drives the long term trend though? </p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20trend.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">Ta-da, its Euro. As Norway is in EEA, its economic tie with EU totally dominates the long term trend of NOK. From the normalized figure, we clearly see the trend of both NOK and EUR are somewhat correlated. To get a formal conclusion, we need a cointegration test. Nevertheless, there is no Johansen Test in statsmodel package (not on the date when the first draft of oil money was finished, but there is now). We would have to use <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointegration#Engleâ€“Granger_two-step_method>Engle-Granger two step test</a>. I have to honorably mention that this method is co-developed by the mentor of my mentor, Robert F. Engle, a Nobel Laureate! Unfortunately, we can't get any confirmation of cointegration from the test. The residual of the first step regression is not stationary under <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Dickeyâ€“Fuller_test>Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test</a>. Sometimes we have to use the old fashion way to make a qualitative judgement, rule of thumb. Most researchers in big organizations recalibrate their forecast with policy or experience or consensus views or simply instinct (as an insider, I guarantee you this is 100% true). This is the moment that I exercise my sacred right to declare that EUR is the driver of NOK's long term trend!</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20EG%20failed.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">Well, I am not an economist (even though my work has a lot to do with them). I do not expect to really find out what happened on 2017/11/15 through our quantamental analysis. Let's call it an end to this twist (if you are an economics-savvy person who is eager to know more, feel free to read <a href=https://www.norges-bank.no/globalassets/upload/publikasjoner/economic_bulletin/2000-04/factorsthat.pdf>this paper</a> by the Central Bank of Norway). In fact, we can simplify our model to NOK driven by Brent. From an econometrician's perspective, it does not sound like a good idea. Every coefficient of the model is statistically significant. Adding more variables does not worsen AIC, BIC or adjusted R squared. There is no incentive for us to remove variables as more information in the model is always better. From a trader's perspective, the requirement is a universal model. Ideally, the model contains two variables, one is the underlying petrocurrency, the other is the local crude oil contract. In this sense, the reduced form model can be replicated to any petrocurrency without too much focus on analyzing trade partners or exporting products. The argument here could be, is linear regression model too naÃ¯ve? <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Patterson_(scientist)>Nick Patterson</a>, a cold war cryptographer who later worked in Renaissance Technologies, said (check <a href=http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/episodes/ai-safety-and-legacy-bletchley-park>here</a> for the original version of 45-minute-long interview), </p><br><h6 class="w3-opacity"><i>One tool that Renaissance uses is simple regression with one target and one independent.<br>Itâ€™s simple, but effective if you know how to avoid mistakes just waiting to be made.</i></h6><br><p class="w3-justify">In the world of modelling, the identification is far more important than the estimation. As long as we find an element with causal effect, there is no need for fancy spatial time series analysis when we can solve everything in its simplest form. We will take the trader's perspective in the following context.</p><p class="w3-justify">Next, let's take a look at the portfolio performance. So far so good, we actually make a few bucks from statistical arbitrage. Interestingly, after we place the stop order, I decide to add an extra position to see what would happen if we follow the trend. In the figure below, we could see the downwards momentum doesn't stop until two months later (probably another major event in financial market). </p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20asset%20value.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">Wow, did we just discover a momentum trading strategy! We started off this project to seek for a statistical arbitrage opportunity between crude price and petrocurrency. What we got in the end is an entry signal of momentum trading strategy. Also, we found out Euro is the major and long term influence on Norwegian Krone, and Brent Crude is the short term disturbance. My explanation for our discovery is that, when the model breaks, there must be something fundamental that change investors' outlook in NOK or Brent, e.g. an increase in north sea refinery capacity limit. That sort of change is supposed to last for quite a while which offers us a chance for trend following (this is how CTA makes money). </p><p class="w3-justify">Here are the rules of our latest momentum trading strategy. </p><ul><li>The first step is always about regression. Run linear regression on NOKJPY and Brent in JPY of the past 50 data points. If the R squared exceeds 70%, the model is deemed as valid, which has successfully verified the petrocurrency status of Norwegian Krone for the past 50 trading days. Then the forecast derived from the model becomes reliable.</li><li>Calculate the standard deviation of the residual. Set +/- two sigma from the predicted price as the threshold to trigger trading signals. If the actual price sits above the upper threshold, the position is net long. If the actual price sits below the lower threshold, the position is net short. </li><li>Once the trade is executed, a counter will start as well. It will keep track of how long the position has been held. If the holding period exceeds 10 days, the position will be cleared. Because the underlying momentum could have vanished into the thin air after such a long time.</li><li>Meanwhile, if the absolute spread between the current price and the entry price exceeds preset limit, which is 0.5 points by default, the position will be cleared to claim profit/loss. The preset spread limit varies along with each individual's risk averse level. When the market gets too volatile, it is sensible to reduce the risk exposure.</li><li>After the position gets cleared, the model has to be recalibrated by the latest 50 data points. Now that a trade cycle has completed, the whole thing goes back to the first step. So on and so forth.</li></ul><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20trading%20positions.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">As shown in the portfolio performance, each momentum takes different length of time to decay. Holding the position too short may not reach the peak of the asset price. On the other hand, Holding the position too long may surpass the peak and head towards the lower side of the profit curve. </p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20trading%20asset.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">Nonetheless, we are not satisfied with the return. We are greedy creatures. 2% return? Why donâ€™t we deposit the money into the current account and get some risk free interest (Norges Bank interest rate at 1% as in 2019/4/30)? We certainly need to tune the parameters, such as different holding period and stop loss/profit point (even the amount of backtesting data points or acceptable R squared level), to maximize the return. After several attempts, we have gathered the below statistics. In average, the return is around 2%, positively skewed. Yet, extreme values can go as far as -6% to 6%. Needless to say, 6% is the goal.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20profit%20distribution.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">The heatmap below is the visualization of return using different parameters. The darker the tile is, the more money you make. From the chart, you can easily tell stop profit/loss point doesnâ€™t have much explanatory power on the return. The return is more correlated with the length of holding period. It makes sense since this is a trend following strategy. The optimal holding period to maximize the return appears to be 9 trading days. The optimal stop loss/profit point is more flexible, which could range from 0.6 to 1.05.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/nok%20profit%20heatmap.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">It turns out that our momentum trading is much more robust and profitable than our original idea of statistical arbitrage. But does it work on any other petrocurrencies? Unfortunately, Norway is one of the largest oil producing countries with floating FX regime. The rest are US, Russia and Canada. US dollar is a totally different case. Petroleum business only takes up a very small share in US economy even including shale boom in Permian Basin. What about Russian Ruble? Well, let's find out! </p><br><h3 id="russian-ruble-and-urals-crude">Russian Ruble and Urals Crude</h3><br><p class="w3-justify">For Norway, I may have doubts in how much petroleum business contributes to its overall GDP. As for Russia, I suspect if any person in her/his rightful mind would question the role of oil in the economy of Russia. According to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Russia>Wikipedia</a>, Russian oil business (mostly Rosneft) accounted for 16% of GDP, 52% of federal budget revenues and over 70% of total exports in 2012. Usually, countries with large natural resource reserves suffer from Dutch Disease (USA is an exception), especially Russia! Hence, we don't need any extra step to validate if Russian Ruble is a petrocurrency.</p><p class="w3-justify">First step, let's identify the regressors. If we look at <a href=http://www.worldstopexports.com/russias-top-import-partners>trade statistics</a>, the biggest trading partners with Russia are EU, China, Ukraine, Belarus, Japan and Korea. Belarusian Ruble BYR is very strange. It has been pegged to both Russian Ruble and US dollar. But the central bank interferes the currency rate too frequently. I would argue the currency regime is a completely mess (thanks to oligarchs). I'd rather not include Belarusian Ruble as it is not a big player in global or regional economy. So we are left with Euro, Chinese Yuan, Ukrainian Hryvnia, Japanese Yen and Korean Won. </p><p class="w3-justify">Australia, another country with rich natural resources, basically doesn't make many direct trades with Russia. Fantastic! Australian dollar can be leveraged as the base to evaluate RUB,EUR,CNY,UAH,JPY and KRW. Instead of Brent, Russia has its own version of blending called Urals. We would take Urals spot price as a benchmark for oil. Apart from Urals, Russia also exports natural gas to Europe via Gazprom. The best benchmark for natural gas in the continent is Dutch TTF gas future contracts. When the tension of Nord Stream 2 pipeline is settled, the benchmark is probably gonna be German NCG gas future contracts (or maybe some extra benchmarks for South Stream and Power of Siberia). The saying goes, gas is the power and oil is the money when it comes to Russian exports. There we go, the preparation is done.</p><p class="w3-justify">Yet, Russian Ruble is very special. Russia has been sanctioned by US and EU for so many times (really feel sorry for those innocent Russian civilians). To know when and what, someone actually creates a <a href=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-sanctions-timeline/29477179.html>timeline</a> for us. Each major sanction should make a huge impact on the currency. In this case, we use a method called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression>stepwise regression</a> to test each potential regressor for each year. We would pick out the R squared winners out of 7 variables from the past 4 years to construct a robust model. The figure below shows R squared of each variable for each year.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/rub%20stepwise1.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">The figure below shows R squared of each variable for cumulated years.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/rub%20stepwise2.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">Here are some interesting facts. Apart from Japanese Yen, Korean Won and Ukrainian Hryvnia, R squared year by year on other currencies or commodities are literally plunging from 2015 to 2018. The biggest cause is the sanctions. Ever since the annexation of Crimea, military intervention in Syria and nerve agent attack in UK, the sanction on Russia is getting more and more severe. Most countries except some rogue ones (e.g. China, Iran, Venezuela) decline to trade with Russia. Thus, we are able to observe the R squared downhill of Dutch TTF gas, Euro and Chinese Yuan over the years. Even though R squared on Urals jumps up in 2018, there is another key indicator that warns us of the danger. We would find out very soon. Before that, it is also strange that there are some spikes of R squared on Japanese Yen. My initial guess was that Japanese Yen became the safe haven for Russia turmoil. Frankly, it is more of a coincidence after some digging into the data. The spikes are simply because of the sluggish growth of Japan economy, which coincides with the downtrend of Russian Ruble. The same applies to Korean Won. As for Ukrainian Hryvnia, its R squared barely exceeds 20% so we simply ignore it. Now let us take a look at R squared of year cumulated. We could easily draw the same conclusion as before that R squared of most regressors are declining over the years (Korean Won looks like a bell shape curve though). 2017 and 2018 seem to be the roughest years for Russia. In that case, I prefer to split the backtesting data into pre-2017 and post-2017.</p><p class="w3-justify">For pre-2017 data, the model seems to be very robust. Urals alone explains more than 80% of the price movement of Russian Ruble. The introduction of Euros into the model is optional. It indeed increases a significant amount (more than 2%) of R squared compared to other regressors. AIC, BIC and adjusted R squared also justifies the theory. Although in the following models, we would only include Urals Crude as a regressor. The reason behind that is to keep the model consistent across different currencies and different commodities (recalled from NOK section, we prefer trader's perspective).</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/rub%20ols%20-2016.PNG" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/rub%20model%20-2016.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">For post-2017 data, we can tell this is when the sanction bites. Urals can only explain less than 30% of the price movement of Russian Ruble. Moreover, the coefficient of Urals is even negative which contradicts the fact that Russian Ruble is a petrocurrency.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/rub%20ols%202017-.PNG" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/rub%20model%202017-.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">If we track the price for Urals, Japanese Yen, Euro and Russian Ruble from 2017 and 2018, we will get a clear picture of how these assets move along the time axis. The stagnant performance of Japanese Yen and Euro implies the post-recession economy growth of two of the most influential blocs in the world. The surge of Urals from the beginning of 2018 does not translate into the performance of Russian Ruble. The sanction on Rusal which deeply disrupted aluminum market and the sanction in response to Russiaâ€™s gas attack on UK soil hit Russian Ruble further down.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/rub%202017-%20trend.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">In terms of trading strategies, Russian Ruble is too geopolitical event driven for any quantitative analysis. What we do here is trying to split the data of each year with a ratio of 30:70 into training and testing. We would apply whatever we have learned from the training dataset to backtest our momentum trading entry points. For the first two years, our model captures pretty solid R squared. The actual price of Russian Ruble barely drifts two standard deviations away from our forecast price. Nonetheless, there are two sides of this story. The good news is that our model identification is perfectly correct but the bad news is that our strategy only works when the model begins to break. We only want the model to be 80% correct instead of 100%! As an old saying goes, there is no way to beat the markets if the markets are fully efficient.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/rub%202015%20positions.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/rub%202016%20positions.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">For 2017 and 2018, the R squared becomes total failures. It drops from less than 10% to less than 1% within 2 years. Still, you can argue that this strategy sort of works. When the model breaks in 2017, the downward pressure on Russian Ruble lasts more than a month. Although it sounds very tempting for the wide margin we can exploit, the R squared for that model is only 7%! Is it really worth the risk? I don't know what you folks think. I had a formal academic statistics training. A model with ridiculously low R squared and insignificant coefficients does not appeal to me. I strongly urge people to be cautious. When the model isn't robust (say R squared less than 50%), this trading strategy isn't plausible.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/rub%202017%20positions.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/rub%202018%20positions.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">My conclusion for Russian Ruble is DON'T TRADE IT!! Its political agendas always screw up its petrocurrency status. A recent article by <a href=https://www.ft.com/content/d841992a-021c-11e9-9d01-cd4d49afbbe3>Financial Times</a> coincides with my theory. Trading is more like a marathon rather than a 100m sprint. Nobody would love to see sanctions kick in like BÃªte Noire. I don't really think Russian Ruble is worth the risk. Is that it? Nope, lucky for us, we still have one more petrocurrency, Canadian Dollar, to test our strategies.</p><br><h3 id="canadian-dollar-and-western-canadian-select">Canadian Dollar and Western Canadian Select</h3><br><p class="w3-justify">For some bizarre reason, everybody says Canadian Dollar is a petrocurrency. We all know Canada is a country with huge deposits of natural resources. However, it never strikes me as a heavy weight player in the petroleum industry. According to <a href=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/science-data/data-analysis/energy-data-analysis/energy-facts/crude-oil-facts/20064>Canadian government</a>, Canada is the fourth largest crude oil exporter. But hey, why does it catch so little attention in the oil market? Because 96% of its production is shipped to Uncle Sam. Similar to U.S., Canada has oil pipeline bottleneck as well. Both have attempted to expand the capacity. But both have faced huge resistance from indigenous people and environmental protection. </p><p class="w3-justify">For Canada, there are two major local crude oil contracts we need to take into consideration. One is Western Canadian Select. In contrast to the conventional crude oil, WCS comes from oil sands. It is extracted via open pit mining or steam injection rather than oil rig drilling. The molecular level of WCS is quite heavy and its sulfur content is graded as sour. The other local contract is called Edmonton Synthetic Crude. It is a form of light sweet crude oil upgraded from oil sands. The upgrade facilities break down the heavy molecule and remove sulfur content from bitumen. Thus, the synthetic crude can directly flow to refinery as inputs. Because the crude oil export mainly serves the Yankees, we choose West Texas Intermediate, the domestic benchmark for U.S., instead of Brent. You can check <a href=https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/5e6f425a-e1c7-441a-9aa0-64890e4ecade/resource/b7080f88-f748-45f0-8294-81d32a7a834c/download/13-Explaining-oil-price-differentials-formatted.pdf>Alberta government website</a> for the pricing of WCS.</p><p class="w3-justify">Based upon the information from <a href=https://www.trademap.org/Index.aspx>International Trade Centre</a>, mineral fuel is not the only export. Canada also exports a lot of other natural resources including natural gas, precious gems, base metals and agricultural products. In that sense, we also welcome gold and LNG into the model.</p><p class="w3-justify">Despite both Canada and Australia are in Five Eyes Alliance, the trade flow between Canada and Australia is quite limited. Australian dollar becomes the ideal base currency. Canada is a member of NAFTA. It is no surprise that both United States and Mexico are Canadaâ€™s predominant trading partners. Also, Canada is in the ring of Asia Pacific. It maintains active trading relationships with west Pacific countries like Japan, China and Korea. The only surprise is the trade flow between Canada and EU (including UK). Hence, we come up with a model contains WCS, Edmonton, WTI, LNG, Gold, USD, MXN, EUR, GBP, JPY, CNY and KRW.</p><p class="w3-justify">When we run regressand on each regressor individually, in-sample data regression shows no sign of petrocurrency at all. None of the hydrocarbon products (as highlighted in the figure below) have R squared over 5%! The astonishing result really contradicts the market belief that Loonie is a petrocurrency.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/cad%20model.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">Nobody has expected 35% of the outcome can be explained by UK Sterling and Chinese Yuan. It is quite unusual that US dollar does not have the strongest R squared. If we look at GBP and CNY, normalized values on forex imply UK Sterling and Chinese Yuan were in sync until Brexit referendum ruined everything. The cointegration between GBP and CNY doesnâ€™t make a lot of sense. Is it because of the golden era between UK and China?</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/cad%20currency.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">If we look at the hydrocarbon products, normalized values on crude oil blends demonstrate that Canadian blends are indeed associated with West Texas Intermediate. The light sweet synthetic crude is closely stick to the movement of WTI. WCS drifts off the course occasionally. It is probably caused by some tightening market condition (e.g. the reduction of heavy sour refinery capacity by force majeure). In general, all three crude oil contracts move towards the same direction. With that being said, we can exclude the possibility of faulty petroleum data. So where does the theory of Canadian petrocurrency come from?</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/cad%20crude.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">Letâ€™s take a step back and look at what most market analysts focus on. Most studies on Loonie use raw exchange rate of CADUSD. As shown by the figures below, Loonie and WCS priced in different currencies show diverging results. It appears that so-called petrocurrency status is possibly due to the dollar effect. Most commodities are evaluated in US dollar. Itâ€™s very intuitive that the commodity price in US dollar tends to show a smaller volatility compared to the commodity price in other currencies. The reason is quite simple. For commodities priced in other currencies, they need to convert to US dollar for international settlement. US dollar is the one and only global currency (hopefully Euro can find its rightful place). Given the bid and ask spread of currency exchange, it tends to widen the gap between currency and underlying asset. Some studies use trade-weighted exchange rate. Nevertheless, the bilateral trade between Canada and U.S. makes up 75% of the trade surplus for Canada. The significant impact of dollar effect on trade-weighted exchange rate makes it de facto CADUSD.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/cad%20wcs%20in%20aud.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/cad%20wcs%20in%20usd.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">Our finding is still not solid enough. Recall how Russian Ruble gets flagged by aggressive espionage? Perhaps Canadian Dollar shows different attributes across different time horizon as well. It is definitely not caused by sanction. It could be the monetary policy change by central bank or one of the revolutionary reforms by Justin Trudeau (no sarcasm intended). To confess, Canada is not the spotlight of the financial market, so most people are not familiar with its internal situation. Thanks to the over publicity of machine learning, we have the luxury to borrow some tools from <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning>unsupervised learning</a>.</p><p class="w3-justify"><a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/machine-learning/blob/master/k%20means.ipynb>K-Means</a> is applied here to find out the clustering on time horizon. Loonie, WCS and date are the dimensions. There are various techniques to determine the optimal number of the cluster. For this mission, both elbow method and silhouette score are taken into consideration. I have encountered several occasions that two metrics give out two different answers. That is why we ought to use different methods to reach a final decision. Fortunately, we can observe the consistent performance of K-Means with K equals to 2. Thus, we shall split the dataset into two different parts.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/cad%20elbow.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/cad%20silhouette.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">There are some shortcomings of using K-Means. While most cluster problems in machine learning focus on discrete variable, the autocorrelation of time series is not taken into account. Hence, we need to visualize the data to make a judgmental call. In some cases, cluster A is uniformly distributed across the time horizon. we do not see a clear threshold on a specific date to separate two different clusters. Lucky for us, we get a clean cut on March 2nd of 2016. The boundary of two clusters is a flat surface on z axis.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/cad%20kmeans.gif" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">Donâ€™t ask me what happened on March 2nd of 2016. I did a thorough search in the historical archives but came back empty handed. Nonetheless, even if we split the timeframe in regard to the threshold, we still cannot observe a significant R squared from in-sample regression. For the first period, we get respectively 20% R squared. And for the second, we get roughly 10% R squared. It seems that I cannot justify the causal relationship between Loonie and WCS. Is Canadian Dollar really a petrocurrency?</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/cad%20groups.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">The next step is to conduct out-of-sample regression. The result surprisingly outperforms in-sample regression. For each period, we take a 70/30 train test split. The R squared is guaranteed to be above 20%. Though it hasnâ€™t hit our 70% target. If we merely take a look at the visualization, we will see the actual price is often within the two standard deviation bandwidth.</p><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/cad%20before.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/master/Oil%20Money%20project/preview/cad%20after.png" class="w3-image" width="600" height="450"><p class="w3-justify">In a nutshell, we have exhausted approaches to validate the petrocurrency status of Canadian Dollar. I personally do not believe Loonie is a petrocurrency. In 2018, mineral fuel takes up about 22% of the total export, compared to 53% for Russia and 62% for Norway. Loonie and WCS are in sync if and only if both assets are denominated in US dollar. Therefore, I reject the null hypothesis that Canadian Dollar is a petrocurrency. Some market analysts talk about the relationship between Mexican Peso and Maya crude oil. In 2018, the vehicles occupy 26% of the total export. On the contrary, mineral oil is such a niche segment in the export business. The number is as pathetic as 7%. I really hope those analysts can give me a more convincing narrative.</p><p class="w3-justify">Even though Loonie is not a petrocurrency, that shouldnâ€™t stop us from deploying our trading strategy. Unlike the eccentric volatility of Russian Ruble, the political environment of Canada is harmonic, so unusual spikes are not expected. The model per se is based upon rolling period of the past 50 trading days. The market is dynamic so there will always be a moment when both Loonie and WCS enter Nirvana. The bottom line is the preset model threshold. As long as we can obtain a 70% R squared, the game is on.</p><br><h3 id="colombian-peso-and-vasconia-crude">Colombian Peso and Vasconia Crude</h3><br><br><h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3><br><ol><li> Beckmann J, Czudaj R, Arora V (2017) <a href=https://www.eia.gov/workingpapers/pdf/oil_exchangerates_61317.pdf>The Relationship Between Oil Prices And Exchange Rates: Theory And Evidence</a></li><br><p><small><i>This paper was documented by US EIA.
